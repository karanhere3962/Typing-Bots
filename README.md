# 10fastfingers
A small program to automate the typing test in 10fastfingers.com website. Written in python. This program is meant for learning purposes only and I am not realiable for any malpractice using this code. Made by - Karan Kumar Chettri

Setup Required - you need a few things to run this program:
- Python 3.x installed and configured (mine is 3.6.0)
- Install selenium using the "pip install selenium" command. Run this command in cmd if your using windows, terminal if your using linux.
- Download chrome webdriver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads . Include the address of its containing     folder in path of environment variables if your using windows.
- Detailed instruction about installation can be found in this link - http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

After completion you are all set for running the program. Just run it through terminal or cmd. It gives around 361wpm in around 30 seconds in my system, result varies with processor and not the net speed.
